# Learning Sequence Patterns in Knowledge Graph Triples to Predict Inconsistencies
This work investigates the feasibility of utilising the subject-predicate-object (SPO) structure of KG triples to detect possible inconsistencies. The key idea is hinged on using Freebase-defined entity types for extracting the unique SPO patterns in the KG. Using Machine Learning, the problem of predicting inconsistencies could be approached as a sequence classification task. The approach applicability was experimented using a subset of the Freebase KG, which included about 6M triples. The experiments proved promising results using ConvNet and LSTM models for detecting inconsistent sequences.
